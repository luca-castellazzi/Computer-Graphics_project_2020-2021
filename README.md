# Computer Graphics Project, A.Y. 2020-2021

## Overview
This is our project for the "Computer Graphics" course @ Politecnico di Milano, A.Y. 2020-2021.

The goal of the project is the implementation of an Endless Flying-Ring-Chaser Game using JavaScript, including different light-styles.

With this project, we obtained a mark of 30/30 in the exam, considering also the assignments given throughout the course.


## How to Play
The goal of the game is to hit the rings in order to make points.\
The game ends if the spaceship hits the ground.

The spaceship is controlled with `W` `A` `S` `D`.\
All light-related settings can be changed either before or after starting the game.

There are 2 different difficulties:
* Easy Mode --> The spaceship is not affected by gravity;
* Hard Mode --> The spaceship is affected by gravity and `SPACE` must be use to control it (the gravity effect starts when `SPACE` is pressed the first time).


## Demo
The demo of the game can be found [here](https://luca-castellazzi.github.io/computer-graphics_project_2020-2021/).
