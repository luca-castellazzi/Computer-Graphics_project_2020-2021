The texture only refers to the X-wing.
For the ring, you need to use a separate shader with a diffuse colour of your choice.
For the terrain you can use a quad with a texture that you like or experiment with more
complex terrains if you can create the mesh from scratch or find it on the internet (not required 
for the fulfillment of the project, the quad is enough).
Remember that you also need to update the position of the terrain according to how the space ship
moves.
